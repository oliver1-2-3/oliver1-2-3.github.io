                    Do you want to know how to design and program the computers powering some of today’s
                    greatest innovations? <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever wondered how your phone knows where the nearest Starbucks is, how
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Google’s self-driving car is even possible, or how your music and photos live in the cloud? <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe you want to know how computers protect businesses — and people — and other cybersecurity issues. <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AUM’s Computer Science Program, with a curriculum based on the latest ACM/IEEE recommendations and an emphasis on high-performance computing, will prepare you for a career in computer programming, networking, database management, multimedia design or technology architecture.</li>
